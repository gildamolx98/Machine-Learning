### Problem Statement:

Predicting Car Prices in the American Market

### Objective:

Develop a regression model to identify significant variables affecting car prices and quantify their impact.

### Available Data:

- Large dataset of various car types in the American market
- Independent variables (features):
    - Car characteristics (e.g., engine size, horsepower, fuel type)
  
    - Other relevant attributes (e.g., safety features, infotainment systems)
- Dependent variable (target):
    -  price
### *Dataset:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FHmYNLs9v0Enc-UExEMpitOFGsWvB2dP/view?usp=drive_link*

### *Tasks:*

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Development
3. Model Evaluation
4. Feature Selection
5. Hyper Parameter Tuning




#### 1. Data Preprocessing:

- Importing libraries
- Handle missing values(no missing values found)
- Remove duplicates, outliers (no dulpicates found)
- Data visualization(object-bar chart,numerics-histogram,heatmap)
- Outliers detection,plotting and their replacement(IQR,boxplot)
- Scale/normalize numerical variables (standardization)
- Encode categorical variables (ordinal encoding)
- Data splitting

   
#### 2. Model Implementation 
 Implement the following five regression algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Support Vector Regressor


#### 3. Model Evaluation 
Compared the performance of all the models based on

- R-squared 

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Identifed the best performing model and justifed.
 
 
 
#### 4. Feature Importance Analysis 
Identifed the significant variables affecting car prices (feature selection by SelectKBest, f_regression)


#### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
Performed hyperparameter tuning and checked the performance of the models.
